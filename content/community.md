## User mailing lists

   [prometheus-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prometheus-announce).

## Discourse forum

Web-based discussion forum at [discuss.prometheus.io](https://discuss.prometheus.io/) hosted by

## Calendar for public events

We have a public calendar for events, which you can use to join us.

If you just want to get an overview, simply use our [web view in your browser's time zone](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=prometheus.io_bdf9qgm081nrd0fe32g3olsld0%40group.calendar.google.com).

If you're using Google products, there's an [automagic link to add it your own Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=prometheus.io_bdf9qgm081nrd0fe32g3olsld0@group.calendar.google.com).

If you're using a different calendar, there's an [.ics to add to non-Google calendars](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/prometheus.io_bdf9qgm081nrd0fe32g3olsld0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

## Social

- [@prometheus.io](https://bsky.app/profile/prometheus.io) on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/).
- [@Prometheus](https://chaos.social/@Prometheus) on [Mastodon (chaos.social)](https://chaos.social).

## GitHub

To file bugs and feature requests, use the GitHub issue
tracker of the relevant [Prometheus repository](http://github.com/prometheus).
For questions and discussions, many repositories offer GitHub discussions.
Generally, the other community channels listed here are best suited to get
support or discuss overarching topics.

NOTE: Please do not ask individual project members for support. Use the
channels above instead, where the whole community can help you and benefit from
the solutions provided. If community support is insufficient for your
situation, please refer to the [Support & Training](/support-training) page.

# Contributing

We welcome community contributions! See the dedicated [Contributor's
guide](/docs/guides/contributing/) to learn how you can get involved.

# Code of Conduct

To make Prometheus a welcoming and harassment-free experience for
everyone, we follow the [CNCF Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

# Legal Umbrella

Prometheus is an independent open-source project and not controlled by
any single company. To emphasize this we joined the [Cloud Native
Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) in 2016 as the second project
after [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
